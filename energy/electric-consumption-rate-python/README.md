# Electric Consumption Rate

## Summary

In this use case we analyse the energy data from 100 commercial/ industrial sites and find out that the consumption rate assigned to each site is correct.

We use predictive modelling to perform this analysis. 

The use case is based on a geographical research, features extraction to identify the time series 
and similarity research to get conclusions about the correct use of the electric consumption rates. 

We are considering that consumption rates are assigned according to the kind of sub-industry sites are established. 

Khiva provides the tools needed to re-dimension the data, extract the features and compose the features matrix for the predictive modelling and to obtain similarities between sites of interest.

## Data

The data folder is expected to be located in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook provided here.

> Note: The file time-series-redimension-applied.npy contains modified data in this use-case after applying a 
dimension reduction technique of the time series.
